#BUS-BOY

###DESCRIPTION

Welcome to busboy, a game where you can use your cloth pulling prowess to shake up the resturant industry.
You just got a new job at Papa Italianos restaurant and you need to bust a LOT of tables and FAST! </br>
The easiest way to start to clean tables is to get these dirty table cloths out of the way. </br>
You could spend all day, clearing tables, removing table cloths, or you could clear and clean tables at the same time without these pesky cloths in the way.
Perfect your timing, and become the king of the BusBoys!
